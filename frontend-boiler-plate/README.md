# Frontend Boiler Plate

This project was bootstrapped with CRA.

## Stack

1. Node (v14.7.0)
2. npm (v6.14.7)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs required dependencies defined in the package.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The project is enabled with hot-loader and the page will reload if you make any edits.<br />
You can also also see any lint errors and warnings in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run update:packages`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you update the packages, you can’t go undo! This might break some dependencies and its functionalities!**

Updates all the installed plugins to the latest version.

This will remove all the current versions of the plugins(packages) installed and install the latest available versions of the same.

This could lead to broken features and unstable plugins depending on the versions. Use only if necessary.

### `npm run createBuild`

Install the packages and builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
